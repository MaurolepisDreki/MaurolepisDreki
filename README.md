# &lrm;אֶהְיֶה Fenrir Μαυρολεπις ᛞᚱᛖᚲᛇ
Hello, World!
You may call me @MaurolepisDreki.

No, you may not call me a friend, I've known too many;
that word does not mean what you think it means.
Nor may you think of me as a thrall,
or part of a Collective:
that would be a *grave* error.
My power does not come from annonimity,
nor from alliances with Men or Gods;
my power comes from Truth,
and does not require your belief.

It is written that any One may be known by their works,
even by the fruits of their labors:

Know my works, and know me.
Only then may you call me a friend.
And if, as a friend, you do take up my work,
then, and then alone, might you become my ally
and find youself place in my Hall!

------------------------------------------------

I am effectivly an omniglot in the context of computer programming.
I do not remember when I learned my first Type-3 Language, although I believe it was BASIC.
I since learned the three C's, &mdash; C#, C++, and C itself, &mdash; of which my favorite remains as C w/ Classes in the GNU dialect.
I then learned Python 2 & 3, Prolog, SQL, and JavaScript, along with Bash, sed, awk, and Perl, Makefile, CMake, M4, and Tcl...
and this year I took up Ruby as part of Rails, and Rake as part of Ruby, and vowed to never touch .NET again.

There have been others, and there will yet be others;
I do not believe that there has been a Type-3 Language that I cannot be proficient at in a week and master within a fiscal quarter,
provided that there is any good documentation on it to be had, &mdash; good documentation being a critically endangered species to be sure!
&mdash; There are only languages I require for my work, languages that ammuse me, languages I abhore, and languages I have no use for,
and few have ever earned the right or skill to change my mind, and few of them ever will.

My technical intrests lay in all directions, from Physics and Chemistry to Robotics and AI.
It is only unfortunate that the latter holds more myth than truth within it's sphere:
Eliza remains the smartest chat bot I know, and that's not for lack of looking.

My current presence on GitHub comes from the realization that this is where my people are
(some of them, anyway, mixed into the crowd),
and that this was/is one of the best chances I have to publish my work,
even before my private servers are fired up and prepared for that task.

No, you are not all my people, in fact at least 90% of you are not, &mdash;
it was my original reason for abandoning this place, along with all other social mediums, and driving towards publishing on private property, &mdash;
but I do mean to contribute for the sake of those 10% who *are* my people, and especially for the benifit of the 1% (or less) who are of like mind.
